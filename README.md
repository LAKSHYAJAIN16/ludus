# Ludus

**Ludus** — The social network built *exclusively* for high school communities.  
***Where classmates connect, organize, and stay in touch — for life.***

---

## About

Ludus is a private, school-centric social media platform designed to bring high school students together in a safe, focused environment.  

Unlike mainstream platforms, Ludus requires users to sign up with their official school email, ensuring authentic communities limited to classmates only. This means no random strangers, no doomscrolling, and no creepy DMs — just real school connections.  

Ludus supports classic social media features plus event organization and communal chats, making it the go-to app for everything student life — from study groups to parties.  

Importantly, Ludus communities persist beyond graduation, providing a lifelong space to reconnect, reminisce, and organize reunions.
